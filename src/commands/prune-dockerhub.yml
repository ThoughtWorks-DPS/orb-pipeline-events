  Delete artifacts from dockerhub registry.

  Often a CI pipeline will need to write frequent development builds of a docker image to a
  registry as part of the development process for applications intended for deployment within
  a kubernetes namespace.

  A useful step upon tagging a release candidate is to remove the dev builds from the registry.

  This command accepts a regex pattern for identifying the tags to be removed from the registry.

  Note that this has not been optimized for repositories with 1000s of images.

parameters:

  repository:
    description: dockerhub repository to prune
    type: string

  tag-filter:
    description: search parameters to find desired iamge tags
    type: string

  registry-login:
    type: string
    default: DOCKER_LOGIN

  registry-password:
    type: string
    default: DOCKER_PASSWORD

steps:
  - run:
      name: prune docker registry
      environment:
        DOCKER_LOGIN: << parameters.registry-login >>
        DOCKER_PASSWORD: << parameters.registry-password >>
        REPOSITORY: << parameters.repository >>
        TAG_FILTER: << parameters.tag-filter >>
      command: <<include(scripts/prune_dockerhub.sh)>>
